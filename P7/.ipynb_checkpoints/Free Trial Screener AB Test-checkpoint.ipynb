    "## Overview\n",
    "At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the home page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. This screenshot shows what the experiment looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page."

    "### Invariant Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The invariant metrics that were chosen were:\n",
    "* Number of cookies: Number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. This was chosen because it is the unit of diversion.\n",
    "* Click-through-probability: Number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page. CTP is a better option than number of clicks because it accurately tracks how many independent users move on to the next page. Since the experiment occurs after the \"Start free trial\" button is clicked, the CTP should not vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "The evaluation metrics that were chosen were:\n",
    "* Gross conversion: Number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. A statistically significant change in the experiment will tell us how the experiment affected a user in enrolling in the free trial.\n",
    "* Retention: Number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout. A positive stastically significant change here will show some evidence suggesting that overall user experience was improved by informing users of the required time commitment.\n",
    "* Net conversion: Number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. A positive stastically significant change here will show some evidence suggesting that overall user experience was improved by informing users of the required time commitment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics Not Used\n",
    "* Number of user-ids: That is, number of users who enroll in the free trial. With this metric alone, we are unable to tell if the experiment had a positive or negative effect with a statistically significant change between experiment and control.\n",
    "* Number of clicks: Number of unique cookies to click the \"Start free trial\" button. There might be a slim chance that this metric may be unreliable if there were usability issues during the time when the experiment was launched or in the control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Results\n",
    "If the experiment is successful, I expect the users who don't have the time commitment will not complete checkout and enroll into the trial. As an effect, the number of user-ids should statistically decrease, and of those users who wish to enroll into the trial, a higher percentage of them should convert into paying users. The expectation of the evaluation metrics based on my conjecture are as follows:\n",
    "* **Gross conversion**: I expect the number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll to decrease. This metric, as an effect, should stastically decrease.\n",
    "* **Retention** and **Net Conversion** should show a positive statistical significance, due to the expectation that a higher proportion of users who have enrolled possess a better idea of the time commitment required to take the course."
